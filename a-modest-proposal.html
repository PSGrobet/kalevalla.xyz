        <p>The idea of decentralized or distributed social networks comes as a response to the many problems that centralized (mainstream) social networks have developed over the years like:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                <p><strong>Privacy</strong>: the company that owns the servers owns all the data you produce on their platform and has the right to use it as they see fit. Of course, they have some form of “Privacy Agreement” where they say they don’t do any nefarious thing with it, a) but can you believe them? And b) are they really bound to honor that agreement?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Censorship</strong>: They own the platform so they have right/responsibility to “moderate” to make sure no “disinformation” or “harmfull” information spreads on their platform. The problem is that there is a very fine –almost transparent, depending on who you ask– line between “moderating” for the safety and comfort of the community and “censoring” for the benefit of their own political agenda, whether that skews to one side or the other.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Algorithms</strong>: “If it’s free, you’re not the customer, you’re the product”. And what is their product? Your attention, which they sell to the companies that advertise in their platform. And in order to have more product to sell they have to secure as much of your attention as they possibly can. And in order to do that they will resort to many devious, manipulative methods to get you practically addicted to being constantly connected. This is in short what’s known as “algorithms”. Over the years they have found many different ways to incentivize your constant prescence, and many can be extremely negative; one of the worst, and also one of the most effective, is the idea that very few things keep your eyeballs stuck to the screen like controversy, polarization, and general negativity.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In short, mainstream social platforms have become toxic, almost cancerous, and need to be extirpated from society.</p>
        <p>But, are the current idea of decentralized social platforms the right answer?</p>
        <p>They do try to adress these problems in some way or another.</p>
        <p>The concept of decentralization itself is an answer to mostly the problem of <strong>censorship</strong>: since the very structure of the platform means your data is not centrally hosted in just one particular server or data center, owned by any one entity, then it can’t be censored, because it could be removed from one server, but still exist in another completely independent server.</p>
        <p>As for privacy and algorithms, I don’t think they have a good enough answer yet. Their main answer seems to be that there is no <strong>monetization</strong> whatsoever, thus there is no reason for them to sell your data or to create any algorithm to manipulate you. But, even assuming we can trust them because they say they are all about open-source, non-censorship, etc., that generates it’s own problems, namely: they become <strong>unsustainable</strong> and there is no incentive for <strong>growth</strong>. They depend on maintainers who must be both techically savvy and ganerous with both their time and money. There aren’t too many like that. Enthusiasm is great, but it’s not a real strategy for the long run.</p>
        <h4 id="the-answer">The Answer:</h4>
        <h3>Free as in freedom doesn’t necesarilly mean free as in free beer</h3>
        <p><strong>Some one has to cover the costs of hosting the servers, right?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Let the user be the customer; <strong><em>but make it really cheap</em></strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Let the maintainer have some incentive other than enthusiasm; i.e. <strong>monetary</strong>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Let the maintenance be stupid easy so anybody can be a maintainer; also it helps with it being cheap for the customer.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I say it is, in fact, a more free environment when everybody knows exactly what they can expect, demand, and what their role is in the ecosystem.</p>
        <h4 id="so-what-does-this-look-like-in-reality">So what does this look like in reality?</h4>
        <h3 id="the-protocol">The Protocol</h3>
        <p><strong>In one sentence: </strong>A lightweight, decentralized social network powered by <strong>small, independently hosted PHP nodes</strong>, with a unified client experience, no ads or algorithms, and fair, transparent economics.</p>
        <p>The idea behind the protocol is quite simple, and it could potentially apply to many things, not just social platforms. Like any such application it has two sides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Server side:</strong> An application with a straight-forward installation for any shared server environment; just as you would rent a simple shared hosting server and install WordPress in one click. The maintainer doesn’t even have to do any design or big configuration, just basic registration. It’s open-source, can be downloaded from the official website, github, torrent, etc. Gets a dashboard where he can monitor activity in his server and track fees to his paypal account.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Once you install the software in multiple servers, they all connect to each other and create a network of servers that act like a decentralized data-center, or like one big server. Information is distributed seamlessly, efficiently and with the necessary redundancy.</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>There is no "each user registers in one particular server" like on <em>Mastodon</em>, that just creates unnecesary silos and tribalism.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Maintainers get a fee proportional to the number of users in the network; all transparent and egalitarian.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The network allows or blocks new servers entering the network according to demand. Potential maintainers may enter a waitlist.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Client side:</strong> The user/customer buys the app from any appstore or the official website, and either pays a fee at installation, or later at registration.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Everything is open source so it’s auditable; the financial incentive is covered by the user, so there is no room for evil algorithms or data brokering.</p>
        <p>The registration/installation fee is very cheap and is calculated to cover the expense of renting a regular shared hosting where the server software is hosted. An average of low-tier hosting service may cost around US$6/month ($72/year) and the capacity of said host is good for 100 active users; a $1/year subscription fee would generate $28 gain average per server at full capacity. It’s no get-rich-quick type gains, but it’s enough passive income to be more incentive than just sheer enthusiasm for the platform. Or you could make it $2; it’s still cheap, but how much would the average user be willing to pay for something they already get “theoretically” free from <em>Meta, X</em>, etc. But for the assurrance of no data-mining and algorithm manipulation and with enough network effect, $2/year may very well be worth the price.</p>

        <h4>In summary:</h4>
        <h3 id="the-problem">1. The Problem</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Social media is broken.</strong> Centralized platforms monetize your attention with ads, algorithms, and surveillance—fostering toxicity, tribalism, and burnout.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Federated alternatives (e.g., Mastodon) often fragment into siloed “instances,”</strong> reproduce tribalism, and rely on volunteer enthusiasm with no clear growth incentive.</p>
            </li>

            <strong>PS:</strong> As it stands, this isn't any more than an idea, and ideas aren't too rare and by themselves they aren't worth much (at least in the tech world), what is valuable is the implementation of the idea. I would love to say that I'm the right person to develop this monster of a project, or even to collaborate with a team and do it. I am in the process of <a href="https://github.com/PSGrobet/modern-php-course" target="_blank">teaching myself php</a> but that's a bit far from materializing yet. So I'll just leave this here and if someone sees it and wants take a stab at trying, be my guest, it would be awesome if you invite me to the project, or at least talk about it.
