             I'm not a good a reader, not even remotely as good as I would like to be, for sure. But I like books. Paper, digital, makes no difference. I read physical books when I can get my hands on them, or on a Kindle, on Calibre, on the <a href="https://github.com/wustho/epr#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">terminal</a> if I'm feeling cheeky, if I'm reading something cyber/cypherpunk... even on the phone, but that's mostly for listening to the "read aloud" feature on the e-book reader app while doing dishes. I like to scroll my Calibre Library and just browse the more than <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/blog/020-the-12k-ebook-library" target="_blank">20,000 digital books</a> that I have there for entertainment, I like that better than scrolling on social media these days.

            This is neither exactly a list of books I recommend, or have read, or "to be read". A little bit of all that, or maybe just books that have caught my attention and want to have saved on a list somewhere.
        </p>
        <h4>Cypherpunk books</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Cypherpunk</strong> is closely related to <strong>Cyberpunk</strong>, but not exactly the same; it's more  about the encryption, internet surveillance, anonymity stuff, and a bit less about about the ultracapitalist-cyber-dystopia themes and less body modification.
        </p>
        <p>
            -> <strong>Fiction</strong> (most of these, including the comment, are from recommendations found on Reddit.)
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Karl Schroeder, <em>Stealing Worlds</em> &mdash; (This is probably runner-up to Doctorow. All about building a society outside of government control based on block chain, etc.) 
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="flex-li">
                    <p>Daniel Suarez, <em>Daemon</em> and <em>Freedom</em> &mdash; (While they don't concentrate much on encryption, they sure as hell do on online identity and trust.) &mdash; <strong>Started reading <em>Daemon</em>, pretty good.</strong></p>

                </div>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                Vernor Vinge, <em>Rainbows End</em> &mdash; (Identity and trust feature in it)
            </li>
            <li>
                Neal Stephenson, <em>Cryptonomicon</em> &mdash; (So very much encryption, lol)
            </li>
            <li>
                Cory Doctorow &mdash, <em>Little Brother</em> (is <em>Mr. Robot</em> referencing this???), <em>Walkaway</em>.
            </li>
            <li>

                    <p>
                        William Gibson, <em>Neuromancer</em>. &mdash; <strong>Not entirely sure if this is cypherpunk or just cyberpunk, like I said, the line is a little blurry.</strong>
                    </p>

            </li>
            <li>Rudy Rucker, <em>Ware Tetralogy</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Non-Fiction. </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Edward Snowden, <em>Permanent Record</em> &mdash; <strong>read it, awesome book, more of an autobiography, but it does have some interesting bits about cryptography and anonymity.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Jullian Assange, <em>Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet</em> &mdash; <strong>I'm a couple chapters in; very interesting. It's a discussion between him and a couple of activists about cryptography, privacy, surveillance, etc.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="flex-li">
                    <p>Shoshana Zuboff, <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em>.</p>
