        <h2 id="blog-005">Give me the adds but keep the trackers</h2>
        <h3>08-12-2025</h3>
        <p>
            Some people complain that the internet started going to shit when every page started displaying adds. Well, it couldn't just be free forever, right? There are millions of websites out there that are not really trying to sell you anything, just share information. I do believe that, genuinely, some people just want to share their knowledge and opinions and engage with other like-minded people. But that information still has a value and there is also a cost to broadcast it. I also believe in the right to monetize what you know, so if you know a lot about plants and want to write a website about that, why shouldn't you make some money off of it? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, the question is <strong><em>how</em></strong> that money is made. I believe there are ethical ways to make money and there are <em>un</em>ethical ways to make it; it boils down to a simple principle: <strong><em>consent</em></strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are just showing the reader a few adds in your page, the reader can see them and dismiss them and keep on reading the content, and maybe there's a 0.01% chance that they'll click on the add if it's something they are interested in; there is still consent here. It's a small chance, but with enough readers, that small percentage makes the add worth it for the advertiser. As soon as you start adding trackers <em>behind</em> the adds, there is no more consent because the reader doesn't know they are being tracked, or doesn't know to what extent and what is being done with their information. Whether they click on the add or not, it doesn't really matter anymore, value has already been extracted from them. The reader has become the product. Many websites don't even bother having adds now because <strong>a)</strong> they know that most users have some form of add-block extension; and <strong>b)</strong> they can get more value out of you by selling your data than on the small chance you'll click on an add.
        </p>
        <p>
            See, the problem is not with the adds themeselves, it's what's *behind* them. I would much rather open a web page and see a few adds of unrelated things and know that that's all there is to it, than to have this feeling that wherever I go, whatever I do, I'm being followed, observerd, every click analyzed, and likely even manipulated by algorithms; that not just the adds, but the content itself if algorithmically designed for maximun engagement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I miss the old days when you would open a page, see a banner add at the top and another one in the middle; maybe there was a 0.01% chance that the add was for sommething you might actually care about and would click on it and if not you just had the choice to dismiss them and keep reading the content. It seems like even that choice has been taken away from us. Of course, part of the reason we all started using add-blockers was because those adds just became too much. I mean, on a regular page with adds, almost half of the space in the page is add-space. That's too much. But you get my point.

        <p>
            One of these days I'm going to pay for a proper hosting service just so I can set up a php form so that you, my awesome reader, can send me a message and tell me how much my writing means to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course I know that's probably not going to happen, that's my Social Media addicted brain speaking. Who is even reading this any way? It is a little hard to write things that, in many ways, mean a lot lot me, and have zero idea who reads it, zero dopamine reward; there's no "like", no comments, not even a basic web traffic metric. Is this how it used to be before? Am I just talking to the void? <strong><em>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</em></strong> Is the void looking back? <strong><em>Hello, Void!</em></strong>. But in another way it's easier to <a href="https://theblogera.com/why-write-like-no-ones-reading-because-they-probably-arent/" target="_blank">write like nobody's reading</a>, it's liberating.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a Neocities.org page that I opened about a year and a half ago that I've spent a lot of time at, wrote a buch of things that I'm proud of and in that time managed to get 9 followers. It seems like nothing, but it probably isn't. Besides the engagement (or lack thereof), I am grateful that it gave me a lot of motivation to write more and to search out for other small-web/indie-web pages and communities. It's also just fun. The small engagement features it has &mdash;even if they are very diluted compared to a bigger social network and it certainly helps with the transition&mdash; still make it, in the end, a sort of walled garden, although with a low wooden fence, not a big stone wall... But anyway, bad metaphores apart, I am now completely free from that, now I'm just floating in the wide open sea of the Web, throwing my message in a bottle.

            I saw this image last night and the first thing I thought was that I would run to the computer downstairs and get on the Internet and start learning more about it, maybe start learning how to program and create web pages. I was 8 in 1995. I mentioned <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/free-web" target="_blank">before</a> that I grew up with some awarenes of what the Internet was, or at least that it existed, but I didn't really care too much about it. Maybe I was just too young, or wasn't geeky enough. Shame on me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The thing is, I've come to the realization that what the <strong>small web / old web</strong> means to me is more than just than just nostalgia. You see, as an older <a href="https://www.docudharma.com/tag/4196" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">millenial</a>, I'll be part of the last generation to remember a world without the internet. And more specifically, even though it existed before, I might say that the mass adoption of the Internet hit me at the same time as puberty/adolescence &mdash;what that means exactly I'm not sure, but such a big societal change happening in syncronicity with such an important milestone in life surely has some significance to a person's character.
        </p>
        <p>
            For all that, I've come to the realization that because I had the priviledge too know the Internet as it was in the beginning I feel maybe a little bit of responsibility to preserve at least a part of it, or to try to keep the original spirit alive &mdash;whatever that is exactly, not sure, I'm still <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/blog/017-treasure-hunt" target="_blank">discovering</a> it.

                Click <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/about">here</a> to read a short explanation about how my mind works and how I write websites (it's from my old site at Neocities.org, but the same reasoning still applies); or <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/lingua-franca">here</a> for a longer essay(ish) on the concepts of <em>canon</em> and <em>lingua franca</em> and why I write in English most of the time despite having Spanish as my native language.

            En una lectura inicial de la entrada anterior, podría parecer a primera vista que estoy en contra de usar programas de inteligencia artificial, que opino que de alguna manera equivale a "hacer trampa". No del todo. Tal vez es necesario matizar eso un poco.
        </p>
        <p>
            Por un lado, sí, estrictamente hablando, lo podríamos llamar "hacer trampa". Porque el hecho objetivo es que cualquier contenido que creaste con IA, tus neuronas se tomaron un descanso, además creo que es muy peligroso, no necesariamente por escenarios tipo <em>Terminator</em> &mdash;ese es otro tema aparte&mdash;, lo digo simplemente porque a la larga se nos va a atrofiar el cerebro si no lo usamos. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Pero por el otro lado pienso precisamente que si usamos <em>bien</em> estas herramientas, nos abren un universo de posibilidades que de otra forma podía ser inalcanzable para uno. Pero la cuestión crítica es justamente qué es eso de <strong>"usarlas bien"</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eso puede ser un tanto subjetivo, pero en la base de todo creo que está esta idea: hay que usarlas como herramientas para construir cosas nuevas, pero lo más importante es <strong>no dejar de aplicar nuestro pensamiento crítico, asegurarnos de ser nosotros quienes lleven la conversación, que no sea la IA la que al mismo tiempo propone y construye</strong>. Y, personalmente, el mejor uso que yo le he enconrtado es para aprender habilidades nuevas, y eso a veces también incluye construir algo desde cero, casi completamente guiado por la IA, pero ahí también la clave está en mantener la conversación en el punto crítico donde la IA me está proponiendo cosas apenas un poco fuera de mi alcance, en el <em>"umbral de aprendizaje"</em> correcto: no tan abajo que no aprenda nada nuevo, pero tampoco tan elevado que no entienda nada de lo que está pasando.
        </p>
        <p>
            El mejor ejemplo que he construido con ese método es <a href="https://psgrobet.github.io/space-news/" target="_blank">esta página</a>, un agregador de noticias espaciales usando JavaScript y llamadas a API, cosas que cuando hice, estaba en ese punto entre "entiendo cómo funciona, pero si me dicen que yo lo haga solo, no tengo idea por donde empezar".

        <h2 id="blog-001">Is the Internet dead?</h2>
        <h3>07-29-2025</h3>
        <p>
            Have you heard of <strong>"the dead Internet theory"</strong>? The basic argument is that now, or eventually, most of the content circulating in the  Internet is generated by AI or bots, and not only that, but even most of the supposed engagement is also bots just interacting with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many aspects to it, and it can be easily misunderstood. But here's just a random thought about it all:
        </p>
        <p>
            Just because a lot of the content you read or watch in social media is generated using AI LLM's or image generators, does that mean that the Internet is dead?
        </p>
        <p>
            After all, there is still someone using their creativity to prompt the AI, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, sometimes. You can just as easily prompt ChatGPT with something like "Write the next viral Twitter thread that will get me all the engagement". And it'll come up with something inflamatory and controversial without you even having to decide on the general topic. You could ask it to write about something more specific, like "write a thread about climate change considering the findings of doctor such and such, defending the argument that it's mostly a scam." It's based on <em>your</em> idea, sure, but the choice of words, the disecting and structuring of the particular points within the subject, are not, not really, as much as you try to <em>prompt engineer</em> the text.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The crafting of ideas matters.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            So yeah, maybe, the Internet is dead and all of us here at the <a href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">small web</a> are basically just the post-mortem knee jerking of the cadaver.
