        <h2>Is the Internet dead?</h2>
        <p>You've heard this idea of <strong>"the dead Internet theory"</strong>? The basic argument is that now, or eventually, most of the content circulating in the  Internet is generated by AI or bots, not only that, but even most of the supposed engagement is also bots just interacting with each other.</p>
        <p>There are many aspects to it, and it can be easily misunderstood. But here's just a ramdom thought about it all:</p>
        <p>Just because a lot of the content you read in social media is generated using AI LLM's or image generators, does that mean that the Internet is dead?</p>
        <p>After all, there is still someone using their creativity to prompt the AI, right?</p>
        <p>Well, sometimes. You can just as easily prompt ChatGPT with something like "Write the next viral Twitter thread that will get me all the engagement". And it'll come up with something inflamatory and controversial without you even having to decide on the general topic. You could ask it to write about something more specific, like "write a thread about climate change considering the findings of doctor such and such, defending the argument that it's mostly a scam." It's based on <em>your</em> idea, sure, but the choice of words, structure and particular disecting and structuring of the particular points within the subject, are not. Not really.</p>
        <p><strong>The crafting of ideas matters.</strong></p>
        <p>So yeah, maybe, the internet is dead and all of us here at the <strong>small web</strong> are basically just the post-mortem knee jerking of the cadaver.</p>
