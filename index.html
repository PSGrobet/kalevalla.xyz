        <h2>What is Kalevala?</h2>
        <p>
            "The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalevala" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kalevala</a> (IPA: [ˈkɑleʋɑlɑ]) is a 19th-century compilation of epic poetry, compiled by Elias Lönnrot from Karelian and Finnish oral folklore and mythology,[1] telling a story about the Creation of the Earth, describing the controversies and retaliatory voyages between the peoples of the land of Kalevala called Väinölä and the land of Pohjola and their various protagonists and antagonists, as well as the construction and robbery of the mythical wealth-making machine Sampo."

        <h2>And what exactly is this site about?</h2>
        <p>
            In case you somehow stumbled into here not from <a href="https://github.com/PSGrobet/kalevalla.xyz" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">github.com</a>, this site was firstly an experiment to see if I could host the domain through github pages, which is a neat little skill by itself; secondly, it'll be some kind of blog for my random thoughts, and for practicing while I learn web development. It may even become a permanent home in cyberspace, I will be moving some content here from my site in <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Neocities.org</a> and adding new stuff; in the meantime, you are welcome to browse there too. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You are also welcome to read the <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/about.html">About</a> page from my previous website to learn a bit about my design phillosophy and interests. The same ideas still apply.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, since I have no way of knowing who visits here, because I'm hosting this through github and there aren't even the vague metrics you get in a regular hosting, and there's no way for you to leave a comment, like, or any direct form of engagement, if you like my content you can interact with me in three ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can leave a comment on my <a href="https://neocities.org/site/esegrobet" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">profile</a> at Neocities, if you are a user.</li>
            <li>You can send an email to <em>ese_grobet @ disroot.org</em>.</li>
            <li>If you have site of any sort &mdash;especially of the <em>small/indie/personal/old web</em> persuasion&mdash;, put a link to mine, let me know, and I'll do the same.</li>
        </ul>
