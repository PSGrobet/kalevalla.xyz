		<h4>1. A Recipe Website</h4>
		<p>Where I can log in and add a recipe easily and renders in a minimal UI, no bullshit. Have a form to add ingredients, description, process; store in a database. Render from DB to frontend.</p> 
		<p>* JS or PHP for backend?</p>
		<p>-&gt; In the long run, JS has more future, so may be a good learning project.</p>
		<p>Could clone Luke Smith's recipe website, as a project, could be fun.</p>

		<h4>2. A blog with a CMS</h4>
		<p>Where I can log in, add a blog entry and publish or edit.</p>

		<h4>3. Add proper login to BlacCat</h4>
		<p>Honestly, the whole ephemeral user thing was a bit fun but mostly there just because I was too lazy to add a proper login; but it shouldn’t be THAT hard… or is it? 
		<p> You could still have some <em>pseudonimity</em>: user answers captcha and gets a random user and a random generated password or, better yet, a sign-up screen.</p>
		<p>Don’t know if Claude can continue in the same chat, it’s pretty saturated, or I'll have to start a new one and somehow adapt for the lack of context; but maybe little by little.</p>
		<p>Thing is... I really should stick with JS. I might pull it off vibe-coding the PHP but where's the safe threshold to vibe-code outside of your realm of "expertise"? You feel me?</p>
		
		<h4>4. Migrate Kalevalla.xyz to Vercel</h4>
		<p>Add some site statistics, rss plugin and whatnot, maybe even comments or views. It just werks. <strong>Bonus:</strong> Combine this with #2</p>
		<p>One of the main things I love about hosting on GitHub is I can update the site with a <code>git push</code>, but it turns out I can also do that on Vercel <strong>and</strong> have a backend <strong>and</strong> it's also free... maybe, I'm not 100% clear on that part, I guess up to a certain degree of scaling, but I doubt I'm anywhere near the limit.</p>
		<p><em>Con:</em> Backending with JavaScript sounds hard.</p>
