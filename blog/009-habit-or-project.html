            I stopped writing here for almost two weeks. It doesn't sound like that much but I know this is how it starts. I get sucked into a new rabbit hole and now any other project I had before goes to the back seat.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what have I been doing these two weeks then, you ask? Mostly I went into a Linux tangent. I tried installing a couple distros in VirtualBox, didn't work &mdash;I don't know if it's something with with my computer integrated graphics, or someting with Ubuntu 25.04, but they run super slow, even a supposed "light-weight" distro&mdash;, so instead I decided to install a real Arch partition. First I tried using the "Archinstall" script, but weird things kept happening, so I had to go the long route and install it "the right" way &mdash;which took me a couple of tries, but it's not reeeeaaaly THAT hard&mdash;; and then I've spent the next week and a half configuring it. I actually thought about naming my next post here <strong>"Humbly Running Arch (btw)"</strong>. When people talk about how intimidating installing Arch is, they never say this: installing the OS, the bare-bones Arch Linux system, is the easy part (if you follow the installation guide and don't get too crazy with your disk partition setup); the hard part comes later, setting up connections, keyboard, audio, a graphical environment, whether it's a WM or a DE&mdash;especially for a WM&mdash;, configuring it just the way you like it, making the different programs have a consistent theme, setting up bluetooth... OMFG, goddam bluetooth, I'm still struggling to get that to work properly. But it's an awesome learning experience, that's for sure. You get the idea. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But I think maybe that euphoria has tapered down a little. In the process of my Linux customization rabbit-hole, another thing I did was put I3 window manager on Ubuntu, and spent a few days configuring it before I decided to Install Arch with Sway wm. And I actually like this setup a lot... if I can get the f*@!ing bluetooth working properly again! The Arch partition is still there, I did manage to get it to a point where it's maybe 85% functional and even comfortable to use; I used it continually for a few days and it felt good. But it's the little things that make it unsustainable in the long term... like the mother-f@!$%ng bitch-tooth.

            But besides slowing down down a little on the Linux roller coaster, I have a new old project. Just before that, and this, I was trying to get ChatGPT to teach me PHP. Now I've changed ChatGPT for Claude.ai, which I hear is better with all things programming. But it's not just generically teaching me php, I am developing something like a full ebook/course, it's hand-on, project-based and has (or will have) something of an innovative twist that I think will help a lot in bridging the gap between learner and developer and even avoid tutorial hell alltogether. I'm even making it open-source. I'm excited about this project, you can learn more about it <a href="https://github.com/PSGrobet/modern-php-course" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, regarding the main question from the title, I was thinking about this blog, it started as a project. Like I wrote in the intro, it spawned from a question whether I was able to host a propper domain in github pages, and it didn't need to, but it sort of naturally gravitated towards being a blog. But I want it to be more of a habit. Not because of any following or interaction but because I find it very amusing to track my many trains of thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            So it's a project to turn this into a habit, while I try really hard to not to let my other projects die (mainly the php course, the Linux ricing thing can take a back seat.)
