            I was just thinking of how there are these Distros that are seen as "for beginners", "too easy", etc, and others that are seen like "real serious Linux". And, well, I've been using Linux as my "daily driver" OS for the past, I think, 5 or 6 years now, more than the average Linux user, and I've come back to Ubuntu. Part of it was that I have a new laptop and I was  little afraid to mess it up by installing something exotic and weird. But honestly, I'm enjoying it. I just werks. I have more interesting things to do with my time, than fighting through endless config files in a ton of different programming languages just to display a minimize button on a window or to get the bluetooth to work, or whatever. Don't worry, I'm still learning a ton about Linux, but that's just what I choose to do with my computer; any other user might choose to just play games and log in to Discord and watch YouTube, or do some actual work on something unrelated where they just need a reliable functional OS, but have their own reasons for not using Windows or Mac; and they will choose Ubuntu, Mint or Pop!_OS, because it would be nearly impossible for someone who is non-technical &mdash;by this I mean that they have no interest in learning; everybody has the capacity, but not the interest&mdash; to accomplish that with any other distro.

            <strong>And that's fine.</strong>

            This is Linux. It's all about the freedom to do what you want with your machine, no more, no less, have the tech work for you and not you working for the tech.

            <strong>It's all about the freedom.</strong>
