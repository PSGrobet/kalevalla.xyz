            So it seems that I am changing paths... again... <strong>OMFG, will you stick to one thing already?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, I think that it's not too bad because each time I change I'm <em>refining</em> my path a little bit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Before, I was on the <a href="../fullstack-js-learning-path.html">JS fullstack</a> path mostly because I naively saw frontend as a necessary entry point; but as I move on I am feeling more and more clearly that what really interests me is the <strong>backend</strong>. Not that frontend doesn't have a lot of interesting parts, it does, but I think my interest in the frontend ends at having a good-looking but simple, minimalist personal page; after that it gets too tedious for me to think about design, color palettes, or SEO... &mdash;I really hate SEO, I don't understand why everybody just keeps playing Google's game without question. I like <em>basic</em> things, as in, things related to the <em>base</em>, the <em>essence</em>, low-level, how servers and networks are built. I like to know how things work from the ground up. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that's been a constant in my life: it's the reason I chose the bass and not guitar, it's the reason I learned how to make sourdough bread and not desserts, the reason I'm attracted to classical literature and nature.            
        </p>
        <p>
            But for now I'm testing, because backend does have a lot of things that seem pretty daunting to me but at the same time intriguing.
        </p>

            I found this course that apparently <strong>everybody and their mom</strong> is doing right now called <a href="https://boot.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">boot.dev</a>, so not breaking my head thinking too hard on the roadmap. A part of me is tired of thinking about <strong>what</strong> to study and just wants to follow some short, cozy, fun lessons on a roadmap that's carefully planned by someone who knows a lot more than I do. I do think that there's a value in forging your own path; but for now I'm gonna take a little rest from that and see if this one takes me where I want to go.
