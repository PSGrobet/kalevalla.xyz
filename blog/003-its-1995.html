            I saw this image last night and the first thing I thought was that I would run to the computer downstairs and get on the Internet and start learning more about it, maybe start learning how to program and create web pages. I was 8 in 1995. I mentioned <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/free-web" target="_blank">before</a> that I grew up with some awarenes of what the Internet was, or at least that it existed, but I didn't really care too much about it. Maybe I was just too young, or wasn't geeky enough. Shame on me.

            The thing is, I've come to the realization that what the <strong>small web / old web</strong> means to me is more than just than just nostalgia. You see, as an older <a href="https://www.docudharma.com/tag/4196" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">millenial</a>, I'll be part of the last generation to remember a world without the internet. And more specifically, even though it existed before, I might say that the mass adoption of the Internet hit me at the same time as puberty/adolescence &mdash;what that means exactly I'm not sure, but such a big societal change happening in syncronicity with such an important milestone in life surely has some significance to a person's character.

        <p>
            For all that, I've come to the realization that because I had the priviledge to know the Internet as it was in the beginning I feel maybe a little bit of responsibility to preserve at least a part of it, or to try to keep the original spirit alive &mdash;whatever that is exactly, not sure, I'm still <a href="https://esegrobet.neocities.org/blog/017-treasure-hunt" target="_blank">discovering</a> it.
