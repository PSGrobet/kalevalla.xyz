        <h3>08-26-2025</h3>
        <p>
            I'm thinking I have gathered enough blog posts here that it's probably worthit to switch to a more normal blog format, with an index and separate page for each blog entry; easier to share independently, more structured and whatnot, and I think it's also better for RSS sharing, which I wan to implement soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            That implies a bit of work restructuring the site and links, and all that, so it might take me a couple days <em>(or a couple hours, depending on how much my job interferes my hobby)</em>. I will say, hosting this on Git and being able ti update evrything with just a <code>git push</code> is awesome; the downside is I cann't have any kind of backend, and I've been learning some PHP, and thinking about setting up some kind of comment box, or something like that.

        <div class="alert1">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are seeing this box it means I already did the update. This entry refers to the old format where I had every entry on a single thread instead of this new page-per-entry format. It had it's charm, but it feels more clunky after it's more than just a few entries.</p>
