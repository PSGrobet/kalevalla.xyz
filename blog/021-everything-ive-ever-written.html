            I was thinking that it might be fun if I put together everything I’ve ever written –between short stories, blogs and what not, even some social media posts–, filtered, but loosely, into one single place and it would probably be a couple book’s worth of material; and some of it, maybe a not entirely insignificant part, might even be readable.

            It would be a considerable task since a lot of it is buried deep in past backups of computers from long ago. I even still have some notebooks from my late teens/early twenties.

            Why would I do that, you ask?
        </p>
        <p>
            Because what good are the petabytes and petabytes of information going back and forth on the the Internet continuously if not for speaking out your mind?

            <strong>PS:</strong> Also, I just found out that I have a domain sitting idly the registrar, apparently I bought it about 6 months ago, I guess thinking that it would be my web portfolio. And I’m learning about Cloudflare tunnels. That means the dream of a self-hosted website is back on, baby!
