        <p>It's the beginning of November 2025 and I've been in my current bout of programming/webdev/it learning for the past three months so I thought it's a good point to make a quick recap. Why do I say "my <em>current</em>"? Well, <a href="#">this is not the first one</a>.
		<p>Three months doesn't sound like a lot, but when you consider mi ADD &mdash;ok, I don't have a diagnosed ADD, maybe just very bad disciline (which I also think is the case with most self-diagnosed neuro-atypicals)&mdash; it kind of is, in these three months I've oscillated a few times between HTML/CSS, deep-diving into Linux, PHP, JavaScript; but it's all part of the same thing. and it's also statistically about the averege length of how long I maintain focus and interest.</p>
		<p><strong><em>... But this time it's different</em></strong></p>
        <p>The main reason I believe this time it's different is because this time I actually made an investment: I bought a laptop (on credit). That is one thing that is keeping me motivated. I also quit smoking; that is slightly tangential, but also not really, one of the reasons for that is that it will make it a little bit easier to make the payments for the laptop, the other one is that smoking damages your focus and overall energy and awareness levels on the long run, so not smoking is helping me study better; it also helps with getting up an hour earlier than usual to study.</p>
		<p>Aside form that, what keeps me motivated? Like all the youtubers say: <em>"Remember your why"</em> Sounds cheesy, but sure, I'll play along. I've thought a lot about it, actually.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				One big part is just the thrill of learning programming itself, I like to say: <em>"I just like the way it tickles my brain"</em>. I don't have a technical background, but I like the kind of problem-solving it involves. Of ourse, that's not enough; when that's the only source of motivation, that's when it's fun for a while and then I get distracted by something else and drop it. And I've tried hard to rewire my brain to not care that six months later when I take it up again I'll have forgotten a lot and practically have to start from scratch again, because it's just a fun hobby and yes, it's alright, for the most part; but deep down a part of me does get frustrated by that.
			</li>
			<li>
				The other part, which I think is important to keep a more long-term motivation is: I want to, and I do believe I can, make the switch to work as a developer in the not-too-distant future, maybe a year from now, full time? I'll read this again in a year and see where I'm at, I hope it doesn't sound too ridiculous then.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A big part of the "remeber your why" motto is that it has to be specific or it doesn't work. So being more specific:</p>
		<p><strong><em>I want to be an independent freelancer web developer, working to help small businesses grow by creating the websites and web solutions they need... and get payed for that.</em></strong></p>
		<p>There, I said it, happy?</p>
		<p>Statements like that are always cheesy and you look back at them a few months or years latter and think it sounds dumb, they are not meant to be permanent, just usefull as a temporary general framework, something to think about when I'm wondering why should I study a certain topic and if I can trace line between what I'm learning and my grand goal, even if that line is blurry and ambiguous, then that helps to keep me motivated.</p> 
		
		<h4>So what have I been up to anyway?</h4>
		<p>I should've done this sooner because it seems that three months of bouncing around are enough to make it hard to recall accurately. But I'll try, even if it's not as precise as I would like.</p>
